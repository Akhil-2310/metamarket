### What is it all about?

Web3 and crypto is very gaining a lot of traction these days. Though, the starting point for the same is still a hassle and therefore we need to change this. People are afraid to start using web3 in day to day life but we as an ecosystem, need to change this narrative and bring more and more people to web3 space.

### How can we do it?

This can be done by bringing the most basic things like grocery, food, clothing onchain and even people's fine art. So basically, anything you can think of can be bought/sold onchain using crypto. Hence, we have built a ecommerce web-app, MetaMarket.

MetaMarket is a cross-chain, decentralized marketplace built with React, Solidity, Li.Fi SDK, and Circle CCTP v2. Users can seamlessly bridge USDC from one chain to another and purchase goods in a single transaction.

When people will start buying day to day things and essentials onchain is where mass adoption takes place. MetaMarket is an ecommerce app where there is no centralization. It is not another nft marketplace where people can just buy and sell nfts but where people can list whatever products they want to sell. People who want to buy that product can buy that product using USDC.

### Features

- 🔁 One-Click Bridge & Buy using Li.Fi SDK with Circle CCTP v2

- 🌉 Cross-chain USDC Support between Base and Linea

- 💸 USDC Payments for all transactions

### How is the project made?

All the buying and listing of products is controlled by the smart contract. The interface is built using vite where users can list their products and it will appear on the marketplace. The buyers who want to buy the products can buy the same within seconds from the marketplace. The contract is deployed on Linea Mainnet and Base Mainnet.

### Future Scope

Collaborating with delivery services and partners to make physical products reach the people's homes.
