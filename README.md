## What is it all about?
Web3 and crypto is very useful. Though, the starting point for the same is pretty tough and therefore we need to change this. People are afraid to start using web3 in day to day life but we as an ecosystem, need to change this narrative and bring more and more people to web3 space. 

- How can we do it?

This can be done by bringing the most basic things like grocery, food, clothing onchain and even their fine art. Hence, I have built a ecommerce web-app, Social. When people will start buying day to day things and essentials onchain is where mass adoption takes place. Social is an ecommerce app where there is no centralization. It is not another nft marketplace where people can just buy and sell nfts but where people can list what products and also their art pieces they want to sell. People who want to buy that product can buy that product using any cryptocurrency they want to. People can choose in whatever cryptocurrency they want to buy and sell their products. But what if people don't have crypto in their wallets? There's no need to worry, they can buy crypto with fiat in few seconds and a click. 

- How is the project made?

All the buying and listing of products is controlled by the smart contract. The interface is built using vite where users can list their products and it will appear on the marketplace. The buyers who want to buy the products can buy the same within seconds from the marketplace. The contract is deployed on Linea Mainnet.

- Future Scope

Collaborating with delivery services to make the product reach the people's homes.
